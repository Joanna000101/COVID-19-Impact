Discovered in December 2019, COVID-19 quickly spread throughout the world. In March 2020, The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. It was not until December 2020 that effective vaccines were discovered. By now, COVID-19 has more than 635 million cases and more than 6 million deaths. Counties seal borders; people wear masks; school and works go virtually. As the epidemic continued, the economy started to recess: companies became bankrupted, and people struggled with continued unemployment. Though countries respond to the pandemic differently, most countries commit huge losses. The global economy suffers during and after the pandemic. The pandemic dramatically changes daily life and global dynamics. We are curious about the global and local impact of COVID-19. What is the worldwide impact of COVID-19? How do the regional impacts of COVID-19 differ from region to region? What are the potential reasons for the difference? We focus on the impact of COVID-19 in China. China has a large discrepancy in economic development across regions (East, Middle, West). The eastern region includes cities such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shandong and etc. They are relatively closer to the ports on the east coast, and trade makes a huge contribution to the economy. However, central and western regions of China relies heavily on natural resources, such as coal, copper, rare earths, and animal husbandry. In addition, the eastern region of China is mostly plain, livable, and has a large population, and keep attracting a large number of outstanding elites every year, while the western region is mostly plateau, sparsely populated, and the lack of talents also leads to low-tech industries and low labor costs. Also, their infrastructure and medical resource in Middle and West region is lagging behind. We are curious about whether the COVID’s impact to China’s economics is different across regions, and we will probe the interactions between regions of China during the pandemic. We will only use provinces in mainland China (excludes Taiwan, Hongkong, Macao) for policy consistency, and our research target is mainly focus on economic aspect. Firstly, we use global GDP and US Dollar Index to gain an overall view of global economy from 2018 to 2021. Then we narrow down to COVID-19 impact on Chinese economy. Provincial GDP of East/Central/West China can reveal the impact of COVID-19 on regions which have different levels of economic development. Transportation cost data are used to explore the impact on transportation within and between provinces. Total import and export data can reveal the impact on international trade. Wholesale and retail trade data are used to measure offline transaction activity. At last, we visualize unemployment rate as a lagging indicator to measures the effect of economic events. We apply techniques including faceting, Cleveland dot plot, scatter plot, Mosaic plot, spatial data visualization, etc. to explore the impact of COVID-19 on Chinese and global economy. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic 2.2 Data availability For the Covid-19 data, we download data from Harvard Dataverse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MR5IJN). It contains 15 files including China Basemap,cityConfirmed, cityDeath, cityRecover and all those time-series data are at provincial level. It would be a good dataset for us to analyze China’s pandemic trend and severity stages across time. We also compared this data set with data from Google Covid-19 open data (https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/raw-data) and World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int/data). We prefer dataset from Harvard because it includes provincial data, but we will still use WHO’s data for a brief overlook at the global level. For the provincial time-series economics data in China, we download data from China National Bureau of Statistics (https://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=G0104), which includes provincial GDP, Transportation Increment, Retailing Increment, Registered unemployment, Provincial Export, Provincial Import and etc. CNBS is the dataset built by the government and is considered as the most authoritative data for China, and we will use this dataset to measure economics overlook, supply-chain cost, offline store’s operation, unemployment and China’s trading account. We downloaded the USD index from Investing.com. The data from Investing is consistent with data from Bloomberg, but it’s free for students outside Business School. For analysis of COVID-19’s impact to USD index, we use time series data that range from 2018.10.31 to 2022.10.31. We choose this data because USD index is a good measure of investor’s panic index from the Economist’s perspective, for USD is considered as the safest asset in the world and investors tend to buy USD when the probability of recession increases. All of our data are in csv or excel format. The data downloaded from CNBS is in a good stage, with no missing values and is in panel data format. The data from CNBS is collected by Chinese government from all provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) and some counties (cities, districts and flags). The database is built through investigation teams formed by Chinese government and is considered to be precise. On the other hand, China’s COVID-19 data downloaded from Harvard Dataverse is sparse and has some missing values. Harvard Dataverse is updated to January 14, 2021. it was daily updated on the numbers of COVID-2019 confirmed, recovered, dead, foreign imported cases with Chinese provincial and city level base maps in the format of Shapefile. This dataset starts from January 15, 2020. In future, if the data have problem, we can contact the owner of dataset through the “Contact” button provided by Harvard Dataverse’s website. The good thing is, lots of scholars are using this database for research right now, and their citation and dataset’s related publication is tractable. We can also contact them if we need further academic discussion.

For the provincial time-series economics data in China, we download data from China National Bureau of Statistics (https://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=G0104), which includes provincial GDP, Transportation Increment, Retailing Increment, Registered unemployment, Provincial Export, Provincial Import and etc. For stock price data and US index data, we downloaded from Investing.com. The data from Investing is consistent with data from Bloomberg, therefore its credibility is validated. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation For the processing of China’s economic data, we use differences in growth rates to better illustrate the impact of the pandemic, because most provinces’ GDP still grew during the pandemic, but at a slower rate. 3.3 Missing value analysis There is no missing value in china_economics.xlsx. We can verify this by drawing the below graph to show the location of missing value: There is missing volume in US dollar historical index, but we only used close price of it.

The GDP of these countries accounts for more than half of the world GDP. They well indicate the global economy. We can observe from the graph that most of the countries, expect China, experienced negative GDP growth in 2020. Most of the countries, expect China and Germany, experienced the lowest GDP growth in 2020. The global economy was not going well during the pandemic.

The six currencies included in the USDX are often referred to as America’s most significant trading partners. So, the index implies the strength of US dollar. US Dollar is considered as the safest asset in the world and investors tend to buy it when the probability of economic recession increases. When more people invest in USD, it is stronger. The US dollar index is a good measure of investor’s panic and global economy. We can obverse from the graph that the US dollar index increases dramatically around March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The pandemic lowered investor’s confidence in global economy and motivated more investment in safer asset, such as USD. This trend corresponds to what we observed in the previous graph: the global GDP growth dropped significantly during the pandemic. Reference: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usdx.asp The COVID-19 pandemic will have an impact on different provinces and industries in China. During the outbreak in 2020, transportation, retail, urban registered unemployment rate, total import, total export, net export and other industries all showed a slow growth trend. This pattern of decline is concentrated in the Midwest. As we know, the development of eastern China mainly depends on its technology and services, while the development of central and western China, such as Shanxi, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, takes advantage of its abundant resources (coal, metals, cotton). Companies in these areas produce primary products and transfer them to eastern China or abroad for further processing. To better illustrate the downward trend, we use the percentage change in growth rates between 2020 and 2019 to measure the decline. To ensure that the worse the indicator, the darker the map, we use the negative sign of the original value to draw the graph. As we can see from the chart below, the GDP growth rate of most provinces in China declined from 2019 to 2020, especially the central provinces. Hubei, the province where the epidemic first broke out, saw the biggest drop. The situation is similar in neighboring provinces of Hubei. As we can see from the chart below, the GDP growth rate of most provinces in China declined from 2019 to 2020, especially the central provinces. Hubei, the province where the epidemic first broke out, saw the biggest drop. The situation is similar in the neighboring provinces of Hubei. As can be seen from figures 2 and 3, western and central China suffered the greatest losses in terms of transportation and retail sales. Especially Hubei and Xinjiang. Xinjiang has a famous port called “Horgos”, the largest railway port in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which mainly supports the development of Xinjiang’s textile and clothing industry, as well as foreign trade and service industry. Lockdown policies in western provinces tend to be stricter in the west, which will have a negative impact on traffic and retail revenue in western provinces. We analyze unemployment in the fourth chart. From 2019 to 2020, the rate of unemployment growth in most provinces was positive. We can only see declines in a few western and central provinces. In figures 5, 6 and 7, we focus on the transaction records of Chinese provinces. Provinces close to the border have seen a drop in imports and exports. Between 2019 and 2020, the growth rate of net exports in Tibet and Yunnan fell sharply. The impact on the eastern region is slighter than the Midwest. As noted above, the western provinces tended to have more restrictive lockdown policies, and their economies were more dependent on trade in resources and raw materials. We believe this is a contributing factor to the above results. ## Loading objects: ## chinadf "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 7 Interactive component", " Chapter 7 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 8 Conclusion", " Chapter 8 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
