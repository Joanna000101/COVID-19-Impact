<p>Recent years have witnessed the significant impact of COVID-19. Discovered in December 2019, COVID-19 quickly spread throughout the world. In March 2020, The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. It was not until December 2020 that effective vaccines were discovered. By now, COVID-19 has more than 635 million cases and more than 6 million deaths. Counties seal borders; people wear masks; school and works go virtually. As the epidemic continued, the economy started to recess: companies became bankrupted, and people struggled with continued unemployment. Though countries respond to the pandemic differently, most countries commit huge losses. The global economy suffers during and after the pandemic.</p>
<p>The pandemic dramatically changes daily life and global dynamics. We are curious about the global and local impact of COVID-19. What is the worldwide impact of COVID-19? How do the regional impacts of COVID-19 differ from region to region? What are the potential reasons for the difference? We focus on the impact of COVID-19 in China. China has a large discrepancy in economic development across regions (East, Middle, West). The eastern region includes cities such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shandong and etc. They are relatively closer to the ports on the east coast, and trade makes a huge contribution to the economy. However, central and western regions of China relies heavily on natural resources, such as coal, copper, rare earths, and animal husbandry. In addition, the eastern region of China is mostly plain, livable, and has a large population, and keep attracting a large number of outstanding elites every year, while the western region is mostly plateau, sparsely populated, and the lack of talents also leads to low-tech industries and low labor costs. Also, their infrastructure and medical resource in Middle and West region is lagging behind. We are curious about whether the COVID’s impact to China’s economics is different across regions, and we will probe the interactions between regions of China during the pandemic. We will only use provinces in mainland China (excludes Taiwan, Hongkong, Macao) for policy consistency, and our research target is mainly focus on economic aspect.</p>
<p>Firstly, we use global GDP and US Dollar Index to gain an overall view of global economy from 2018 to 2021. Then we narrow down to COVID-19 impact on Chinese economy. Provincial GDP of East/Central/West China can reveal the impact of COVID-19 on regions which have different levels of economic development. Transportation cost data are used to explore the impact on transportation within and between provinces. Total import and export data can reveal the impact on international trade. Wholesale and retail trade data are used to measure offline transaction activity. At last, we visualize unemployment rate as a lagging indicator to measures the effect of economic events.</p>
<p>We apply techniques including faceting, Cleveland dot plot, scatter plot, Mosaic plot, spatial data visualization, etc. to explore the impact of COVID-19 on Chinese and global economy.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Data availability<a href="proposal.html#data-availability" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>For the Covid-19 data, we download data from Harvard Dataverse (<a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MR5IJN" class="uri">https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MR5IJN</a>). It contains 15 files including China Basemap,cityConfirmed, cityDeath, cityRecover and all those time-series data are at provincial level. It would be a good dataset for us to analyze China’s pandemic trend and severity stages across time. We also compared this data set with data from Google Covid-19 open data (<a href="https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/raw-data" class="uri">https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/raw-data</a>) and World Health Organization (<a href="https://covid19.who.int/data" class="uri">https://covid19.who.int/data</a>). We prefer dataset from Harvard because it includes provincial data, but we will still use WHO’s data for a brief overlook at the global level.</p>
<p>For the provincial time-series economics data in China, we download data from China National Bureau of Statistics (<a href="https://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=G0104" class="uri">https://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=G0104</a>), which includes provincial GDP, Transportation Increment, Retailing Increment, Registered unemployment, Provincial Export, Provincial Import and etc. CNBS is the dataset built by the government and is considered as the most authoritative data for China, and we will use this dataset to measure economics overlook, supply-chain cost, offline store’s operation, unemployment and China’s trading account. We downloaded the USD index from Investing.com. The data from Investing is consistent with data from Bloomberg, but it’s free for students outside Business School. For analysis of COVID-19’s impact to USD index, we use time series data that range from 2018.10.31 to 2022.10.31. We choose this data because USD index is a good measure of investor’s panic index from the Economist’s perspective, for USD is considered as the safest asset in the world and investors tend to buy USD when the probability of recession increases.</p>
<p>All of our data are in csv or excel format. The data downloaded from CNBS is in a good stage, with no missing values and is in panel data format. The data from CNBS is collected by Chinese government from all provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) and some counties (cities, districts and flags). The database is built through investigation teams formed by Chinese government and is considered to be precise. On the other hand, China’s COVID-19 data downloaded from Harvard Dataverse is sparse and has some missing values. Harvard Dataverse is updated to January 14, 2021. it was daily updated on the numbers of COVID-2019 confirmed, recovered, dead, foreign imported cases with Chinese provincial and city level base maps in the format of Shapefile. This dataset starts from January 15, 2020.</p>
<p>In future, if the data have problem, we can contact the owner of dataset through the “Contact” button provided by Harvard Dataverse’s website. The good thing is, lots of scholars are using this database for research right now, and their citation and dataset’s related publication is tractable. We can also contact them if we need further academic discussion.</p>
