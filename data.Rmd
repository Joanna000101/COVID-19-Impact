## Missing value analysis

There is no missing value in china_economics.xlsx. We can verify this by drawing the below graph to show the location of missing value:
```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("jtr13/redav")
library(redav)
# Take gdp for example
plot_missing(gdp, percent = FALSE)
# plot_missing(transport, percent = FALSE)
# plot_missing(retail, percent = FALSE)
# plot_missing(unemployment, percent = FALSE)
# plot_missing(import, percent = FALSE)
# plot_missing(export, percent = FALSE)
```
